        <h3>Week 2: An Important Moment in the Development of the World Wide Web</h3>
        <p><b>14 February 2020</b></p>
        <p>Google is undoubtedly an integral part of the World Wide Web experience of most people nowadays. No other search engine to my knowledge has had its name become such a commonly used verb synonymous with “search”, so I think that the beginning of Google is a very important moment in the development of the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>Google was started by <a href= "https://www.thoughtco.com/who-invented-google-1991852">Larry Page and Sergey Brin </a>who met at Stanford University in 1995. The following year, the two of them created a search engine named Backrub from their dorm rooms. This search engine ranked a website based on the number of backlinks it has. A <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink">backlink</a> is a link to a website from another website. This concept forms the basis of Google’s <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> algorithm, named after Larry Page. Page and Brin tried to sell their search engine to Yahoo! in 1997 but were turned down.</p>
        <p>From Backrub, Google was developed and google.com was registered in 1997. Google then became a private company in 1998, while they were based in a garage. The homepage was marked as being in beta until September 1999. As we all know, Google continued to grow from there. Gmail was released to the public in 2004. 2005 saw the introduction of Google Maps and Google Earth. The verb “to google” was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006.  In 2008 Google released their own web browser, Google Chrome, which is now one of the most-used browsers, and in 2011 they made their contribution to cloud storage services with Google Drive.</p>
        <p>There is so much more that Google has done since its inception. It’s difficult to imagine what else they’ll do in the future but it’s doubtful that any other company will overtake them any time soon. It will be very interesting to see what else they will introduce with future technologies and further development of the World Wide Web.</p>

        <h3>Week 1: Character Description</h3>
        <p><b>7 February 2020</b></p>
        <p>Grace Holton is a 25-year-old travel blogger based in Johannesburg, the city she grew up in. She has blonde hair but likes to experiment with different colours every once in a while, and she has green eyes. She is tall and lean, with a willowy demeanour, and has a few delicate tattoos adorning her body. She generally won’t wear her glasses unless she is alone or just very comfortable, so she opts to wear contacts instead. She loves playing around with makeup but isn’t afraid of going out with a bare face. She is very confident and self-assured.</p>
        <p>From a very young age, she’d always been eager to explore and dreamed of being an astronaut to experience the universe. Eventually she settled for something a bit more realistic – seeing as much as she possibly can of the planet she lives on. In 2033, when Grace was 23, South Africa experienced a major economic resurgence. Now in 2035 the rand has strengthened immensely, making travelling all over the world much more viable than fifteen years ago with the rand as weak as it was. </p>
        <p>Grace started travelling back in 2031, mainly for modelling. It was at this point that she started blogging about her travels as well. She grew tired of the modelling part but knew that she had to carry on achieving her dream of seeing the world, so she decided to focus on her travel blog but still does a few modelling jobs on the side. Her blog has gathered quite a following over the years. She mostly writes about her experiences in the countries she’s visited and often shares tips about travelling, as she’s gained quite the knack for it over the past four years and is always discovering new ways to make it as easy as possible.</p>
