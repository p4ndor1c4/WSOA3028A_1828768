            <p>My name is Grace Holton! I'm 25 years old and I'm on a mission to see the world. I'm based in
                Johannesburg, South Africa. I started doing a lot of travelling back in 2031 as part of my modelling
                career, which was also when I started this blog. I have since decided to make travelling my focus as
                it's always been a dream of mine to see the world.</p>
            <p>This blog is where I'll share my experiences of my journeys, travelling tips, photos and the places I
                consider absolute must-visits.</p>
