            <p>(Written from character’s perspective)</p>
            <p>I booked a flight a few weeks ago and soon after I started getting emails from a website called
                Travelcheck. I’d never even heard about this website, let alone given them my email address. Now they
                were sending me emails every few days – it was getting on my nerves. It got me thinking about how on
                earth they got my email address in the first place, so I did some research. The answer? Web robots.</p>
            <p><a href=“https://www.robotstxt.org/”>Web robots</a> are programs that go through the World Wide Web
                automatically, performing certain tasks. As I found out, they aren’t purely responsible for annoyances
                such as scanning for email addresses but some (the legitimate web robots) scan for keywords so that
                search engines such as Google can rank millions of web pages quickly and easily. They are also called
                web spiders or web crawlers. Web crawler sounds fairly harmless in comparison to web spider, which
                sounds quite appropriate for the bots responsible for the spam in my inbox or for sending those messages
                we all seem to get on Instagram inviting you to follow a link to most-likely x-rated content. This
                doesn’t seem to be the case for the names though, from what I understand. I also found out that just
                over half of all web traffic is from <a
                    href=“https://opensourceforu.com/2017/07/web-robots-worker-bees-internet/”>web robots</a>.</p>
            <p>Web robots are also responsible for finding the prices shown in the shopping section on Google when you
                search for something. When looking for accommodation, websites such as Trivago use web robots to find
                prices from various places on the web so that we can get the most affordable option. So, while a lot of
                web robots are used for malicious purposes, there are so many being used to benefit users!</p>
