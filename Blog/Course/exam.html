            <h3>My Choice of External Dependency</h3>
            <time datetime="2020-06-29"><b>29 June 2020</b></time>
            <section>
                <p>I have added a Pinterest board widget to my website’s home page as my chosen external dependency. I
                    would have liked to use something more travel-related but I found that most of these were not free
                    to use. I had thought about using something such as Trip Advisor to show ratings for places Grace
                    talks about in her travel blog or perhaps something like Skyscanner for finding flights. However, I
                    decided to use Pinterest instead.</p>
                <p>I decided to use this because I felt that it would be a good way to enhance the idea of inspiring
                    people to travel, whereas the other options I had considered might lean more towards pressuring
                    people. Pinterest will be one of Grace’s ways of finding places to go and sights to see in whichever
                    country she’s visiting, and collecting those ideas. She also enjoys getting tattoos to commemorate
                    her trips abroad, so Pinterest is also where she finds inspiration for those along with possible
                    studios to get them done. By having the Pinterest board for her next or current trip on the home
                    page of her blog, it gives her readers a quick look at what she’s planning and it allows them to
                    visit her Pinterest account to take a look at her other travel boards to find inspiration for their
                    own trips. </p>
                <p>I like that the Pinterest board adds more to look at to the home page. I had intended on having the
                    home page be very visual and focussed on travel photos, but ended up using only one. I feel that the
                    Pinterest board somewhat makes up for the lack of other visuals.</p>
                <p>I had wanted to add the widget using javascript but unfortunately I kept getting an error that I
                    couldn’t figure out how to fix, so I went the easier way and added the tag for it straight to the
                    html. I also would have liked to use the Pinterest API to allow viewers to pin Grace’s blog posts
                    and photos to their own Pinterest board, but I got rather overwhelmed and confused with it.</p>
