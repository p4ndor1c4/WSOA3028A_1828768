            <section>
                <p>My main intention for the design of my website was to have it look quite minimal. As a travel blog,
                    there will be a lot of pictures. I didn’t want other aspects of the website to distract focus from
                    those, as I feel one of the main things that convinces a person to visit a place is how it looks.
                </p>
                <p>For that reason, I decided that the background will be a plain colour. I wanted the background to be
                    a fairly pale colour, so that the photos will stand out. I chose a simple purple, black and white
                    colour scheme. I chose a pastel purple for the background because I thought it looked pretty and,
                    since it is typically considered a feminine colour, it kind of creates the assumption that the
                    author of the blog is a woman (I don’t really agree with colours having feminine or masculine
                    qualities, but it is what it is). The panel behind the content of the website is white with a purple
                    shadow around it to make it stand out a bit from the background.</p>
                <p>As for fonts, I chose a curly, handwritten type of font for the title of the blog. I chose this one
                    because it doesn’t look too formal, I find it easy enough to read and it looks quite delicate which
                    I like. The font I chose for the main text is also quite delicate while still being easy to read. I
                    chose the font for the headings because it is quite similar to the main font but still stands out,
                    and I feel like that goes quite nicely.</p>
