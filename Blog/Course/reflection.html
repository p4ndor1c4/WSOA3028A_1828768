            <section>
                <p>I am very fortunate to have been able to go on a few trips overseas. I really enjoy travelling and
                    seeing new places and it’s something that I aspire to do more of eventually. I’ve often felt
                    somewhat jealous of, say, people living in Europe because travelling just seems so much more
                    accessible. My parents have often told stories of the travelling they did while living in England
                    until after I was born. I dream of having that sort of experience and it would be ideal if I could
                    have it while still living in South Africa. I also wish for others to be able to go and experience
                    different countries.</p>
                <p>My character is living out that dream. In Grace’s reality 10 years from now, the South African
                    economy is thriving and it is much more affordable to travel the world (a bit optimistic for such a
                    short period of time, I know). Grace wants to inspire other South Africans to travel and experience
                    as much of the world as they can. She doesn’t only write about other countries, but she often writes
                    about experiences in South Africa both for locals and for potential visitors. She’s very proud to
                    call South Africa home and, even though she absolutely loves her time overseas, she always looks
                    forward to returning.</p>
                <p>I created this character as a way to fantasise a bit about being able to travel a lot from
                    Johannesburg. I felt inspired because I had just booked a trip to Dublin to see my favourite band
                    and to visit family, which I was very excited about and it made me feel like it might be possible
                    for me to travel more in the future. Unfortunately that trip has been postponed, hopefully to next
                    year, which has made writing about a travel blogger a bit bleak. I was almost tempted to change my
                    character but then I would have been under even more pressure. At least this character gives me an
                    outlet to think about adventures I’ve had previously and look forward to possibilities in the
                    future.</p>
