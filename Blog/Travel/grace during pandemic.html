            <h2>What Would Grace Be Doing During the Covid-19 Pandemic?</h2>
            <time datetime="2020-03-26"><b>26 March 2020</b></time>
            <section>
                <p>In the year 2020, Grace would have been 10 years old. This means she most likely would have been at
                    home in Johannesburg facing the trials and tribulations of online learning. In her free time, she
                    probably would have been writing, doodling, or playing video games.</p>
                <p>If Grace’s current reality took place in 2020 instead of 2030, that makes this a bit more interesting
                    to imagine. Perhaps Grace would have had to cut a trip short to get back home before any travel
                    restrictions were introduced in South Africa. Perhaps she would have been taking a break from
                    travelling for the beginning of the year, so she would have already been home which would have been
                    much simpler. She would spend her time at home during lockdown quite productively – working out,
                    updating her blog and social media, maybe taking up a new hobby such as embroidery, and definitely
                    planning itineraries for potential future trips. She would probably also have to deal with cancelled
                    flights and getting credit for accommodation that she had already booked.</p>
                <p>During this time, she would probably use her blog posts to motivate people and help them through this
                    difficult time by sharing her routine and giving ideas of how to spend time. She would also write
                    about and share photos of her home and surrounding areas when she gets out. </p>
