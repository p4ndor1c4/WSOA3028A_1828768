            <p>I’d never really thought much about the metaphors we use when talking about digital information and the
                World Wide Web. I’ve just been so used to hearing them that I simply accepted that’s the way things are
                so I didn’t consider the meaning behind them and why they were used, but the fact that they are used
                makes so much sense. </p>
            <p>The internet and all the technology that has come about because of it are intangible. Describing these
                concepts using words people are used to and already associate with tangible things makes them easier to
                fathom. The existing meanings of these words help give meaning to digital technology in a way. They help
                create a better understanding of things that can be fairly difficult to comprehend, in comparison to our
                comprehension of actual physical objects such as a desk.</p>
            <p>My personal favourite metaphor is ‘cyberspace’. Comparing the internet to space provokes ideas of an
                endless potential for exploration. The internet is definitely a tool for exploration and gathering
                information, and the extent of it is about as unimaginable as the extent of space itself, so I think
                this metaphor is quite fitting. The metaphor of your computer’s ‘desktop’ works well because the desktop
                on a computer is usually where we keep shortcuts to what we use the most, just like how people keep
                things that they use often on their physical desks. ‘Cloud’ storage allows us to access data from a
                computer no matter where we are, just like clouds in the sky are usually seen in any location. One that
                I hadn’t actually realised to be a metaphor is ‘torrent’. <a
                    href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/torrent">Torrent</a> refers to a strong stream of water, as
                well as a way of downloading files in parts from multiple computers. The comparison made gives us the
                idea that torrenting files is fast, like a strong stream of water.</p>
