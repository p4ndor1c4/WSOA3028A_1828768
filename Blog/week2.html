            <h3>Week 2: An Important Moment in the Development of the World Wide Web</h3>

            <p>Google is undoubtedly an integral part of the World Wide Web experience of most people nowadays. No other
                search
                engine to my knowledge has had its name become such a commonly used verb synonymous with “search”, so I
                think
                that the beginning of Google is a very important moment in the development of the World Wide Web.</p>
            <p>Google was started by <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/who-invented-google-1991852">Larry Page and
                    Sergey
                    Brin
                </a>who met at Stanford University in 1995. The following year, the two of them created a search engine
                named
                Backrub from their dorm rooms. This search engine ranked a website based on the number of backlinks it
                has.
                A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink">backlink</a> is a link to a website from another
                website.
                This
                concept forms the basis of Google’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a>
                algorithm,
                named after Larry Page. Page and Brin tried to sell their search engine to Yahoo! in 1997 but were
                turned
                down.
            </p>
            <p>From Backrub, Google was developed and google.com was registered in 1997. Google then became a private
                company in
                1998, while they were based in a garage. The homepage was marked as being in beta until September 1999.
                As
                we
                all know, Google continued to grow from there. Gmail was released to the public in 2004. 2005 saw the
                introduction of Google Maps and Google Earth. The verb “to google” was added to the Oxford English
                Dictionary in
                2006. In 2008 Google released their own web browser, Google Chrome, which is now one of the most-used
                browsers,
                and in 2011 they made their contribution to cloud storage services with Google Drive.</p>
            <p>There is so much more that Google has done since its inception. It’s difficult to imagine what else
                they’ll
                do in
                the future but it’s doubtful that any other company will overtake them any time soon. It will be very
                interesting to see what else they will introduce with future technologies and further development of the
                World
                Wide Web.</p>
