            <h3>TikTok's Follow Recommendation AI</h3>
            <time datetime="2020-05-22"><b>22 May 2020</b></time>
            <section>
                <p>I, like many others, downloaded TikTok near the beginning of the lockdown, so <a
                        href="https://twitter.com/MarcFaddoul/status/1232014908536938498">this tweet</a> sparked my
                    interest. The tweet says that when you follow a profile on TikTok, the profile pictures of the
                    recommended profiles look very similar to the one you’ve just followed. I’d never really paid much
                    attention to the profiles that are recommended to me when I follow someone but then I opened the app
                    to see for myself. Lo and behold, I found it to be very true. The recommended profiles from the
                    profile of a fluffy brown dog: a whole bunch of other fluffy brown dogs, a few fluffy white dogs,
                    and a fluffy brown bunny. A white woman who is a makeup artist: other white women with flawless
                    makeup, some of them also stating that they’re makeup artists.</p>
                <p>I realised that this sort of system must also have a hand in what videos are shown on your ‘For You’
                    page. Most of the videos I see there are from profiles that look similar to ones I’ve followed or
                    whose videos I’ve liked before. This formula does make sense on the one hand, but on the other hand
                    leads to having a ‘For You’ page that is not as diverse as it should be. If most of the profiles
                    you’ve followed happen to be white, then the vast majority of videos you see on TikTok are going to
                    be from white creators which leads to creators of other races not getting the amount of attention
                    they should be.</p>
                <p>I found that this was the case on my own ‘For You’ page which I unfortunately hadn’t really noticed
                    until now. The number of videos I would see from black creators was incredibly low because I didn’t
                    follow many people and most of those people that I did follow were white. I don’t really follow
                    people often, but I made a conscious effort to follow the black creators whose content I enjoyed in
                    an effort to diversify what videos I saw. I’ve noticed quite a change in my ‘For You’ page since
                    then.</p>
                <p>I think that this AI is quite harmful because it prevents diversity in the videos people are viewing,
                    even if it isn’t the user’s attention. Even though there are creators of other races making videos
                    about the things you like just like white creators do, they’re almost hidden from you because of
                    TikTok’s AI. Recommendations should be based more on the tags people use in their videos or maybe
                    the other profiles that their followers profile. Users should be seeing videos based off of the
                    content, not the appearance of the creator. </p>
