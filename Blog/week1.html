            <section>
                <p>Grace Holton is a 25-year-old travel blogger based in Johannesburg, the city she grew up in. She has
                    blonde
                    hair
                    but likes to experiment with different colours every once in a while, and she has green eyes. She is
                    tall
                    and
                    lean, with a willowy demeanour, and has a few delicate tattoos adorning her body. She generally
                    won’t
                    wear
                    her
                    glasses unless she is alone or just very comfortable, so she opts to wear contacts instead. She
                    loves
                    playing
                    around with makeup but isn’t afraid of going out with a bare face. She is very confident and
                    self-assured.
                </p>
                <p>From a very young age, she’d always been eager to explore and dreamed of being an astronaut to
                    experience
                    the
                    universe. Eventually she settled for something a bit more realistic – seeing as much as she possibly
                    can
                    of
                    the
                    planet she lives on. In 2033, when Grace was 23, South Africa experienced a major economic
                    resurgence.
                    Now
                    in
                    2035 the rand has strengthened immensely, making travelling all over the world much more viable than
                    fifteen
                    years ago with the rand as weak as it was. </p>
                <p>Grace started travelling back in 2031, mainly for modelling. It was at this point that she started
                    blogging
                    about
                    her travels as well. She grew tired of the modelling part but knew that she had to carry on
                    achieving
                    her
                    dream
                    of seeing the world, so she decided to focus on her travel blog but still does a few modelling jobs
                    on
                    the
                    side.
                    Her blog has gathered quite a following over the years. She mostly writes about her experiences in
                    the
                    countries
                    she’s visited and often shares tips about travelling, as she’s gained quite the knack for it over
                    the
                    past
                    four
                    years and is always discovering new ways to make it as easy as possible.</p>
