            <p>Grace Holton is a 25-year-old travel blogger based in Johannesburg, the city she grew up in. She has
                blonde
                hair
                but likes to experiment with different colours every once in a while, and she has green eyes. She is
                tall
                and
                lean, with a willowy demeanour, and has a few delicate tattoos adorning her body. She generally won’t
                wear
                her
                glasses unless she is alone or just very comfortable, so she opts to wear contacts instead. She loves
                playing
                around with makeup but isn’t afraid of going out with a bare face. She is very confident and
                self-assured.
            </p>
            <p>From a very young age, she’d always been eager to explore and dreamed of being an astronaut to experience
                the
                universe. Eventually she settled for something a bit more realistic – seeing as much as she possibly can
                of
                the
                planet she lives on. In 2033, when Grace was 23, South Africa experienced a major economic resurgence.
                Now
                in
                2035 the rand has strengthened immensely, making travelling all over the world much more viable than
                fifteen
                years ago with the rand as weak as it was. </p>
            <p>Grace started travelling back in 2031, mainly for modelling. It was at this point that she started
                blogging
                about
                her travels as well. She grew tired of the modelling part but knew that she had to carry on achieving
                her
                dream
                of seeing the world, so she decided to focus on her travel blog but still does a few modelling jobs on
                the
                side.
                Her blog has gathered quite a following over the years. She mostly writes about her experiences in the
                countries
                she’s visited and often shares tips about travelling, as she’s gained quite the knack for it over the
                past
                four
                years and is always discovering new ways to make it as easy as possible.</p>
