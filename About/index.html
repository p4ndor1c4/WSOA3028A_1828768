                <p>My name is Grace Holton! I'm 25 years old and I'm on a mission to see the world. I'm based in
                    Johannesburg, South Africa. I started doing a lot of travelling back in 2031 as part of my modelling
                    career, which was also when I started this blog. I have since decided to make travelling my focus as
                    it's always been a dream of mine to see the world.</p>
                <p>This blog is where I'll share my experiences of my journeys, travelling tips, photos and the places I
                    consider absolute must-visits.</p>
                <p>Growing up, I was always eager to explare and I was very fortunate that my family would roadtrip
                    through South Africa from
                    Johannesburg almost every
                    school holiday, with a different final destination each time. We'd pack our bags, pile everything
                    into the car and be on our way bright and early
                    in the morning. On longer trips, such as to Cape Town, we'd spend the night in a little town or on a
                    B&B on a farm along the way so I got to see so much of beautiful South Africa. It's thanks to my
                    parents and the trips they planned that I developed
                    such a love for travelling and exploration.</p>
                <p>Now, all these years later, I've made quite a bit of progress on checking off places on my bucket
                    list of
                    where to visit. This blog is my way of documenting all the memories I've made and the tips I've
                    learned, and sharing the
                    magic of these places with all of you. I hope you enjoy your time here and that it maybe inspires
                    some of you to go out and adventure.</p>
                <p>If you have any suggestions of where I should go or if you want to hear more about any specific
                    place, please don't hesitate to send an email to the address at the bottom of the page! I also have
                    links to my social media pages there. I'm quite active on Instagram where you can find a whole lot
                    of pictures from my adventures.</p>
