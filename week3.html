            <h3>Week 3: Semantic Markup</h3>

            <p>From what I’ve understood from class and through reading articles online, semantic mark-up means that
                HTML tags are used with meaning and give information about what is contained within them. It is about
                more than simply presenting content in a form readable by humans, but also about communicating meaning
                to <a href=“https://html.com/semantic-markup/”>machines</a>. </p>
            <p>The use of semantic mark-up improves accessibility by improving machines’ analysis of web content, thus
                allowing it to be better delivered via tools such as screen readers. This is very important as it gives
                people with disabilities a better, more meaningful experience of the web, as opposed to without semantic
                mark-up. Learning about this really helped me understand semantic mark-up and how useful it is.</p>
            <p>In <a href=“http://seekbrevity.com/semantic-markup-important-web-design/”>this article</a> I learnt about
                how semantic mark-up helps with search engine optimisation. HTML tags have a hierarchy. Search engines
                use this hierarchy to determine the importance of keywords – a keyword in an &lt;h1&gt; tag will be
                deemed more important than a keywork in a &lt;p&gt; tag. This helps search engines to rank web pages.
                This was something I hadn’t really thought about, despite learning a bit about search engine
                optimisation in high school. I was very interested to find out about how search engines and their web
                crawlers look at the code behind pages – I had thought it to be more surface-level than that.</p>
            <p>
                Even though I haven’t written much HTML at this stage, I’ve been very aware of using semantic tags while
                coding. I appreciate that the concept was introduced to us so early on.
